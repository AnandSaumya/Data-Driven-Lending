# **Data Driven Lending: A Study in Risk Management**

*Team members: Zack B., Rishabh A., Saumya A., Prudhvi R.*

This repo is focused on a team project whose aim is to help banks make better lending decisions by improving their credit risk assessment models. A thorough analysis of historical data was done to build a machine learning model that will help predict if a loan will default or not, based on the key performing indicators.

The data source utilized for this analysis was the ‘Loan Default prediction dataset’- provided by Deloitte (authored in Kaggle by Hemanth Sai Garladinne).
